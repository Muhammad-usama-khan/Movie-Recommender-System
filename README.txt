# Movie Recommender System

The movie recommender system is designed to give recommend moveis based off the movie you input into the system.

The data set consisted: 
	- movies_metadata
	- credits
	- keywords

## Running the tests

You can easily test the code by inputting a movie you watched (from the data base) in the getrecommendation function

```
get_recommendations('Batman: Mask of the Phantasm', cosine_sim2)
```
